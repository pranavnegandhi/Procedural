# Background
The demoscene is a familiar programming movement for those those who have been programming since the 80s. It gained popularity due to the increased proliference of low-cost home computing environments such as the Commodore 64 or the Atari ST during the 1980s. These devices were known for their advanced multimedia capabilities (much before the word was possibly invented), and had a distinct edge over the business-oriented computers from the IBM or Apple stables. Rival sceners would compete with bringing out the best capabilities of their chosen platform in dazzling displays of artistic creativity.

What started as basic plain-text credit screens in "cracked" programs, evolved into procedurally generated graphics, animations and music, all packaged into compact executables vying for smallest file size or the best performance or innovative graphical effects.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, demosceners began to adapt Macromedia's Director and Flash applications to build cross-platform demos. This was my first exposure to the movement. Most serious exponents of the movement would be quick to dismiss this new fad. A 20 MB executable with the collective weight of the entire programming team behind Director just did not stand against a 64 KB demo written in C or hand-crafted assembly. But the ease of these environments helped inject new blood into the fold, much of it from creative types such as graphic designers and sound engineers.

The demoscene remains a more or less underground sub-culture even today.

# Procedural

Good quality graphical computing is a tough nut to crack. Not only is the domain itself technically challenging, the added effort of coming up with creative visuals is where many programmers falter. It's a field that requires both artistic as well as technical capabilities.

I spent a few years dabbling in these applications on the side, but never really picked things up seriously. But modern day programming runtimes are fast enough to allow almost anybody with some basic mathematics under their belt to whip up interesting demos. And their performance is nothing to scoff at. This repository is my collection of such effects.
